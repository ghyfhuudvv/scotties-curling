2025 Scotties Tournament of Hearts Previewâ€‹
Selena Sturmay and her Alberta rink are heading to the 2025 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Thunder Bay with high expectations. After a breakout performance at the 2024 Hearts in Calgary, where they reached the final four before falling to Manitobaâ€™s Kate Cameron in the Page 3-4 playoff, Sturmayâ€™s team is poised to make another deep run.

Sturmayâ€™s squadâ€”featuring Danielle Schmiemann, Dezaray Hawes, and Paige Papleyâ€”earned their spot in Thunder Bay without having to navigate the provincial championship, thanks to Chelsea Careyâ€™s team disbanding. This pre-qualified berth has given them extra time to prepare and refine their game under the guidance of coach Ted Appleman.

Sturmayâ€™s team is known for their precision and composure under pressure, and their experience from last yearâ€™s playoff run will be invaluable. With Schmiemannâ€™s steady play at third, Hawesâ€™ consistency at second, and Papleyâ€™s sharp shooting at lead, this Alberta rink has the tools to challenge the tournament favorites.

Team Alberta (Kayla Skrlik)â€‹
Kayla Skrlik returns to the Scotties as Albertaâ€™s provincial champion, bringing a refreshed lineup to Thunder Bay. After a 4-4 record in Kamloops two years ago, Skrlik has made strategic changes, adding Margot Flemming to the team. Flemming, a veteran of four previous Hearts with Northwest Territoriesâ€™ Kerry Galusha, replaces Brittany Tran and brings a wealth of experience to the rink.

Team British Columbia (Corryn Brown)

Corryn Brown leads Team B.C. into the 2025 Scotties with a mix of experience and determination. Brown, who will be six months pregnant during the tournament, has proven her resilience and skill in previous Hearts appearances, posting a 6-6 record in 2020 and 4-4 finishes in 2021 and 2024.

Team Northern Ontario (Krista McCarville)

Krista McCarville and her Northern Ontario rink are no strangers to the Scotties stage, especially in Thunder Bay, where they were finalists in 2022. McCarvilleâ€™s team, which includes Andrea Kelly, Kendra Lilly, Ashley Sippala, and Sarah Potts, boasts a wealth of Hearts experience and a strong local following.

Team Saskatchewan (Nancy Martin)

Nancy Martin returns to the Scotties as Saskatchewanâ€™s champion, bringing a mix of experience and youthful energy to Thunder Bay. Martin, who made her Hearts debut in 2021, is joined by Chaelynn Stewart, Kadriana Lott, and Deanna Doig.

Team New Brunswick (Melissa Adams)

Melissa Adams leads Team New Brunswick into the 2025 Scotties with a lineup that includes Jaclyn Crandall, Kayla Russell, Kendra Lister, and Molli Ward. Adams, a world junior champion in 1998, brings a wealth of experience and leadership to the team.

Team Prince Edward Island (Jane DiCarlo)

Jane DiCarlo returns to the Scotties as P.E.I.â€™s provincial champion, looking to improve on their 0-8 debut in Calgary last year. DiCarlo, who throws third stones, is joined by Veronica Mayne, Sabrina Smith, Whitney Jenkins, and Jenny White.

Team Nunavut (Julia Weagle)

Julia Weagle, sister of Canadian and world champion Lisa Weagle, leads Team Nunavut into the 2025 Scotties. Weagleâ€™s rink, which includes Sadie Pinksen, Leigh Gustafson, and Alison Taylor, returns to the tournament after sitting out inwast sdey gtdfgfdg
